## Activity 1-1:

As you might expect, the headings continue to get smaller as you go from 1 to 6. But when you go to level 7 the text gets bigger. This is because the web browser is written so that it just ignores any tags that it does not know about. This is somewhat of a disadvantage as you donâ€™t get any error messages, things just look wrong, and you have to figure out why.

Incorrect heading closing tags are also ignored. The same reason as to using h7.

## Activity 1-2

__Sample answer for nesting paragraphs:__
```html
<p>
    Test paragraph
    <p> with another paragraph inside</p>
</p>
```

Notice that paragraphs ignore nesting. This is actually correct as in normal documents, there's no such thing as a paragraph inside a paragraph. So as a recommended practice, DO NOT nest paragraphs in the first place

__Sample answer for heading inside paragraphs:__
```html
<p>
    <h1>Test h1</h1>
    Test paragraph
</p>
```

Same thing happens in headings inside paragraphs so dont bother nesting them as well. And if you're stubborn and still do, this will actually create a bug in your markup where css styles __does not apply to paragraphs that have headings inside them!__ (Follow along the instructor as he demonstrate this). So again DO NOT put heading tags in paragraphs.
