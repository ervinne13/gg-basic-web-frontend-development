Motivation: Ideally, we should be able to plow through this subject real quick. This is mostly interview related stuff. When the HR and the technical people interview you, these topics are the bare minimum that you should know and will likely get asked about.

This module will only be a textual representation of what the instructor is discussing about. It's recommended to listen to the instructor more than read here. This is merely a review document of sorts or something you can go back on if you get lost.

## What is UI Design

"A digital medium that a user interacts with".

This means UI Design includes any user interface, that can actually not be digital at all. In our purpose though, we'll be focusing on UI as in the interface that the user will see when using our websites or web applications

## UI vs UX

UX is quite a different subject vs UI. UI deals with the interface, kinda aesthetic in nature. User experience or UX, deals with how the users interact with the UI. Think of UI as the color of a chair, but UX, is how comfortable or ergonomic it is.

We have very limited time so the instructor can only give you the basic concepts but you should read more about "Human-centered design". For our purposes though, whatever we work on, must have:
 - discoverability
 - feedback

## UI Designers vs Frontend Developers

A UI designer handles UI designing and prototyping the screens, while a frontend developer takes those designs and makes them "alive" through HTML, CSS, and (most of the time) JavaScript to make them work on a device (web, mobile, TV, etc.)​.

We're primarily focused on the "Frontend Developer" role but we will also explore the some of the basics of UI designing and try to do our own designs in Adobe XD. To be successful in our field, a frontend developer must also understand the UI and UX designers to better work with them.

## Design Fundamentals

This is really what you need to understand before all of our workshop contents. There are six primary concepts that we will have to learn first:

- Color & Contrast​
- White Space​
- Visual Hierarchy​
- Complexity vs Simplicity​
- Consistency​
- Scale​
