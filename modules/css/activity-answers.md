# CSS Basics Activity Answers

If you haven't tried to answer them yet, please go back to the lesson by clicking [here](/modules/css/index.md).

## Activity 1:

Question 1:
The changed code should be:
```css
p#paragraph2 {
    font-size: 18pt;
    color: red;
}
```

If you said that it will keep the first paragraphâ€™s color blue but change the second to red, your are correct. Why does the second rule over-rule the first? __Because the second rule is more specific.__ You might have thought it was because of the order of the rules, but in fact you can change the order of the two rules and try it and you will see that you still get the same result.

Question 2: Just matching the id is enough. We don't even need to specify what the tag is. Using tags as selector is still good if we are using classes instead.

__Activity 2__

There are two answers for this. One would be what you've learned so far, adding the tag to the selector:

```css
tr.odd {
    background-color: grey;
    color: white;
}
```

The other answer is to match only tables and the classes inside them. This is discussed in the Selector: Matching Children lesson.

Ex.

```css
table .odd {
    background-color: grey;
    color: white;
}
```

__Activity 3__

After you set the `overflow` property, you can guess how each of these values now behave:

- visible = Is the default
- hidden = Hides anything that overflows from the box model
- scroll = Creates a scrollbar 
- auto = Let's the page choose for the best possible value (scroll in this case)

<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            section {
                overflow: auto;
                width: 250px;
                color: black;
                background-color: lightgrey;
                padding: 25px;
                border: 10px solid blue;
                margin: 25px;
                height: 100px;
            }
        </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <section>
