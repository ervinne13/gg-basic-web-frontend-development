# Frontend Web Development Introduction

There will be a lot of things to cover in the next 3 days. Sadly we will have to miss many concepts that are pretty much still required for you to be a functioning frontend web developer so we'll make do of what we can cover for the next 3 days.

Most importantly however, is for you to learn source control management with GIT. This is a universal knowledge when doing ANY kind of software development. Second to that would be knowing how to configure your build tools yourself. We'll explore that with webpack. This will give you the edge over other fresh graduates and will give that extra "shine" in your resume.

## Subjects We Cant Cover but are Pretty Much Needed Nowadays
- Agile Methology
  - The instructor will put up an article for this soon. Meanwhile, he would like you all to research this when we're not on the training.
  - The most important takeaway from here however, is the fact that every development nowadays requires some sort of feedback in the early stages of development. That's why we're also learning Adobe Experience Design.
- Backend Development
  - Since we're already learning JavaScript, you might want to explore NodeJS & Express
  - Other technologies like PHP (especially with Laravel) is still very effective not to mention easier to deploy than its JavaScript counterparts.
- Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript
  - Read up on the instructor's module for this after this workshop [by clicking at this link](https://github.com/ervinne13/gg-mern-workshop/blob/master/modules/js-basics/index.md)
  - For further reading, please read the series of books "You don't Know JS". It's free on github: [click here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). This is a series of 6 books and the instructor uses this as his reference for most of the JavaScript lessons.

## Our Goal

Again, aside from the basics, be able to cover:
- Source Control Management (GIT)
- Basic Build Tools (Webpack)

For the basics

__Adobe Experience Design__
  - Be familiarized with how to create mocks with the tool.
  - Be able to create mocks for both mobile and web and responsive designs.
  - Share your work.

PS: You don't have to be an expert at this (yet) if your goal is development. You just need to understand how it works more or less. This is because it's usually another person's job to do the mocks for you unless you're in a startup and they want a more "full stack" frontend web developer that can also do design.

Note that it's usually better to have a dedicated UI/UX person as it's not just mocks. UI/UX people also do surveys, AB testing, early validation, etc. that most of us developers don't even know how to do well. Plus, their "design sense" is usually more refined than us.

Of course, you may also choose to go this path and only use this workshop to better understand your developers while you do the designs. That's important as you'll be able to do designs that are within development limitations. Your developers will love you.

__Markup & HTML Tags__
 - This will be our very fundamentals

HTML is the actual content of your websites/web applications. This is kind of like the skeleton of your design, an unpainted house if you may.

__Source Control Management__

*This is a MUST LEARN & PRACTICE* if you're really serious about being any kind of software developer (frontend, backend, fullstack, any role that does code). Take this session seriously. We will learn this first as we will practice this on the way while we are doing our activities.

__CSS Styling & Layouts__

You can't be a frontend developer if you don't know CSS. In the later parts of our sessions, we will also be very slightly touching Sass, a superpowered CSS where you can import, do variables, etc on styling. While we may not be able to explore Sass in detail, we will discuss how to set it up at least.

__Responsive Design__

We will be practicing mobile first design as well at least in our project. Here, we will be doing media queries and learn about the viewport and how to manage our content depending on the device size.

__JavaScript__

We will be learning the basics of JavaScript in preparation for us to be able to manage our build tool - Webpack - on day 3. In this session, we'll try to cover basic programming and some advanced es6 techniques required to keep up with Webpack and frontend development in general.

__Webpack__

For (to be) dedicated frontend developers, *this is a MUST LEARN*. This topic may be your hardest so far but bear with the instructor as this (along with source control management) will really make your resume/profile stand out.

We will also be exploring practices on how to better manage your code and reuse components by customizing how our site/app is built.

## About your Instructor

Your instructor is relatively a newbie himself when it comes to full fledge frontend web development (more or less 2.5 years as of May 2019). He's originally a Java/J2EE and Lotus Notes developer and a backend developer for different technologies (Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, .NET) for several years and only did frontend development since 2016. Nevertheless, he learned for experts fron NuWorks Interactive Labs and other creative people so he should be able to give you at least the bare minimum and the current best/recommended practices in the field.

Note: don't be shy asking hime about back end or software architecture as that's his forte and like discussions in that.
