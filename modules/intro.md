# Frontend Web Development Introduction

There will be a lot of things to cover in the next 3 days. Sadly we will have to miss many concepts that are pretty much still required for you to be a functioning frontend web developer so we'll make do of what we can cover for the next 3 days.

Most importantly however, is for you to learn source control management with GIT. This is a universal knowledge when doing ANY kind of software development. Second to that would be knowing how to configure your build tools yourself. We'll explore that with webpack. This will give you the edge over other fresh graduates and will give that extra "shine" in your resume.

## Subjects We Cant Cover but are Pretty Much Needed Nowadays
- Agile Methology
  - The instructor will put up an article for this soon. Meanwhile, he would like you all to research this when we're not on the training.
  - The most important takeaway from here however, is the fact that every development nowadays requires some sort of feedback in the early stages of development. That's why we're also learning Adobe Experience Design.
- Backend Development
  - Since we're already learning JavaScript, you might want to explore NodeJS & Express
  - Other technologies like PHP (especially with Laravel) is still very effective not to mention easier to deploy than its JavaScript counterparts.
- Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript
  - Read up on the instructor's module for this after this workshop [by clicking at this link](https://github.com/ervinne13/gg-mern-workshop/blob/master/modules/js-basics/index.md)
  - For further reading, please read the series of books "You don't Know JS". It's free on github: [click here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). This is a series of 6 books and the instructor uses this as his reference for most of the JavaScript lessons.

## Our Goal

Again, aside from the basics, be able to cover:
- Source Control Management (GIT)
- Basic Build Tools (Webpack)

For the basics

__Adobe Experience Design__
  - Be familiarized with how to create mocks with the tool.
  - Be able to create mocks for both mobile and web and responsive designs.
  - Share your work.

PS: You don't have to be an expert at this (yet) if your goal is development. You just need to understand how it works more or less. This is because it's usually another person's job to do the mocks for you unless you're in a startup and they want a more "full stack" frontend web developer that can also do design.

Note that it's usually better to have a dedicated UI/UX person as it's not just mocks. UI/UX people also do surveys, AB testing, early validation, etc. that most of us developers don't even know how to do well. Plus, their "design sense" is usually more refined than us.

Of course, you may also choose to go this path and only use this workshop to better understand your developers while you do the designs. That's important as you'll be able to do designs that are within development limitations. Your developers will love you.

__Markup & HTML Tags__
 - This will be our very fundamentals

HTML is the actual content of your websites/web applications. This is kind of like the skeleton of your design, an unpainted house if you may.

For futher reading, please read up about the "Creative Commons" to avoid copyright problems when aquiring images for your work.

[Markup & HTML Tags]() - 1.5 hrs
- [Source Control Management]() - 3 - 4 hrs
- [Publishing Your Work (Will become your portfolio)]() - 15 - 20 mins

## Day 2 - Styling, Selectors, & Basic JS Coding
- [CSS - Styling Tags & Selectors]() - 1.5 hrs
- [CSS Page Layouts]() 1.5 hrs
- [CSS Responsive Design]() 1.5 hrs
- [Making Portfolio Progress]() 1.5 hr
- [Basic JavaScript Coding & ES6]() 1 hrs


## About your Instructor

Your instructor is relatively a newbie himself when it comes to full fledge frontend web development (more or less 2.5 years as of May 2019). He's originally a Java/J2EE and Lotus Notes developer and a backend developer for different technologies (Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, .NET) for several years and only did frontend development since 2016. Nevertheless, he learned for experts fron NuWorks Interactive Labs and other creative people so he should be able to give you at least the bare minimum and the current best/recommended practices in the field.

Note: don't be shy asking hime about back end or software architecture as that's his forte and like discussions in that.
