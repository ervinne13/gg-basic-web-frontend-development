# Learning Objectives

Learners will be introduced to the bare minimum knowledge required to enter a frontene web development job. Asides from the very basics, the learners will have to go through the most in demand skill set needed to be a frontend developer: source control management with GIT and configuring build tools (babel, webpack).

Note that backend development & devops will not be covered. This is a frontend concentrated course. We will, however, explore options on how to deploy our work without the need of developing backend services or deploying to a server.
